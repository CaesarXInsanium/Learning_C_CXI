* Purpose

Learning ANSI C programming language. Get good at C programming. Learn of how much
power that it has and be able to use it to level up my Nim programming.

* Miscellaneous

- ANSI refers to American National Standards Institute

* Introduction

- system's programming language, developed for use in Unix systems
- language where most trivial luxuries are not provided built into the
  language or must be defined externally with a standard library.
- single threaded control by default
- floating point is built into the language
- C is a weakly typed language, because any thing and everything is a void
  pointer.

Standard library defines functions, constants and variables for basic interaction
with the OS and basic IO.
