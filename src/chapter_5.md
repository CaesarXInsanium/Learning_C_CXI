# Control Flow

## Statements

- `Expression Statement`: is optinal expresison terminated by semicolon. Basic unit of work.
- `Compound Statement`: list of zero or more statemt existing inside a pair of braces.
- `Selection Statement`: things that are onyl executed if conditions are met. result of if statements
- `continue`: will jump to next loop excution
- `break`: will stop all loop execution and exit. will also end current case statment

## Switch Statement

its the switch statement

- must always have the default label. ALWAYS
- when dealing with enumurations. add a default statment so that if none of th case match, the whole program crashes as a safety measure

## Jump Statements

Unconditional jumping of execution control. Nobody sane uses it for anything other than error handling.
