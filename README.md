# Learn C

Some Notes on the C programming language. I hope to be able to add more information
as I learn more about coding in C

## Effective C

Notes on book 'Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C Programming.
I chose this book over K&R simply because it was cheaper at the time but had
good reviews on Amazon. Also K&R is pretty old.

## Algorithms in C

~I hope to be able to add Notes on Algorithms~
This is a separate repository.

## Practical C

I will be practicing using other projects.
